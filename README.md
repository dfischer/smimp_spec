# SMIMP Specification

## Simple Messaging and Identity Management Protocol

SMIMP is a secure messaging protocol aimed at addressing the flaws and failures of traditional email. By creating a new protocol, designed to be secure from day one, instead of gluing security on as an after thought, SMIMP intends to address the flaws and mistakes of traditional email.

This repository is the main working copy of the SMIMP specification.
